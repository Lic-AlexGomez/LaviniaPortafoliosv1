        <h1 class="tituloAbout">ABOUT ME</h1>

        <div class="center">
          <p class="parrafoAbout space">
            I am a dedicated Pattern Maker and Apparel Professional with over 5
            years of experience in the textile and fashion industry,
            specializing in pattern making, garment construction, and technical
            design. 
            <br /> <br />
            My expertise lies in creating precise and innovative patterns,
            utilizing advanced CAD tools, and developing 3D apparel simulations.
            I have a strong foundation in both fashion design and protective
            clothing, blending creativity with functionality to deliver
            high-quality results.

               <br /> <br />
                My journey began in the fashion industry as a freelance graphic
                designer. After obtaining a bachelor's degree in graphic design, I
                moved on to pursue a career in pattern making and garment
                construction. I have worked on various projects, from designing
                simple patterns to creating intricate textile designs. My passion
                for pattern making and garment construction has led me to
                develop a strong foundation in both fashion design and protective
                clothing.
                <br /> <br />
              Throughout my career, I have contributed to numerous successful
              projects, from designing complex patterns to optimizing garment
              production processes. My work has consistently been recognized for
              its accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to quality standards.
              Currently, I am pursuing a PhD focused on sustainability and
              upcycling in fashion, where I am exploring innovative ways to
              integrate eco-friendly practices into the apparel industry. I am
              eager to bring my skills and passion for sustainable fashion to a
              forward-thinking company, where I can contribute to innovative
              design solutions and continue to grow as a professional. Known for
              my collaborative spirit and problem-solving abilities, I am
              committed to creating apparel that not only meets functional needs
              but also positively impacts the environment.
